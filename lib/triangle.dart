    Right Triangles:
      A right triangle has one 90° angle and a variety of often-studied topics:
      
    Equilateral triangle:
      The Equilateral triangleshown on the left has three congruent sides and three congruent angles.

    Isosceles triangle:
      The Isosceles triangle shown on the left has two equal sides and two equal angles.

    Scalene Triangle:
      The Scalene Triangle has no congruent sides. In other words, each side must have a different length.

    Acute Triangle:
      The Acute Triangle has three acute angles (an acute angle measures less than 90°).

    Obtuse Triangle:
      The Obtuse Triangle has an obtuse angle (an obtuse angle has more than 90°).
